## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify data points from a real-world dataset.  
We explore the effects of different values of `k`, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

> ðŸ“Œ **Inspired by coursework from the IBM Developer Skills Network**, extended independently by ReNewTech Solutions to include enhanced visualizations and fine-tuning experiments.

## ðŸ“ˆ Models Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** Classifier
- Evaluations across multiple `k` values (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Extra Enhancements (Beyond Course Material)

- Automated plotting of **decision boundaries** across different `k`.
- Confusion Matrix heatmaps for better model evaluation.
- Analysis of how `k` selection impacts model bias and variance.
